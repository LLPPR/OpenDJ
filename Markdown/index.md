## Introductory Studio

This workshop introduces DJing as a multidisciplinary collective art form that combines technical skill, creative expression, and social influence. Integral to the role is a theoretical and practical  understanding of engineering collective experience through music. This workshop begins with a  ground up perspective of sound systems and DJ hardware with the aim of building a solid understanding of the ecosystem as a whole. Understanding function provides a stronger foundation for making informed choices when choosing creative tools. The workshop will briefly introduce and highlight methodologies of key aspects of building impactful experiences: musical storytelling, prompted participation, and metaphysical continuity. In the spirit of mentorship and collaboration, this session aims to inspire participants to view DJing as more than just playing music, but as a vehicle to be seen and heard, and as a musician responsible for engineering audience experiences.
