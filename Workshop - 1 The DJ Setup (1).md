Presented by: LP  
Duration: 60 minutes

Changes:  
Revised version incorporates an introductory summary highlighting the key aspects of DJing aligning with the host institution’s culture of self-empowerment, supportive listening and creative voice. It presents DJing as a multidisciplinary collective art form that combines technical skill, creative expression, and social influence, while emphasizing its power for personal empowerment and community building.

Introductory Summary:  
This workshop introduces DJing as a multidisciplinary collective art form that combines technical skill, creative expression, and social influence. Integral to the role is a theoretical and practical  understanding of engineering collective experience through music. This workshop begins with a  ground up perspective of sound systems and DJ hardware with the aim of building a solid understanding of the ecosystem as a whole. Understanding function provides a stronger foundation for making informed choices when choosing creative tools. The workshop will briefly introduce and   highlight methodologies of key aspects of building impactful experiences: musical storytelling, prompted participation, and metaphysical continuity. In the spirit of mentorship and collaboration,  this session aims to inspire participants to view DJing as more than just playing music, but as a vehicle to be seen and heard,  and as a musician with the role of engineering experience.

Workshop Objectives:

1. Introduce participants to the multifaceted nature of DJing   
2. Spark curiosity and inspire further exploration of DJing as an empowering art form (collective musicianship)  
3. Provide a basic understanding of the functions of DJ equipment and sound system ecosystems (stage & sound engineering)  
4. Encourage participants to think creatively about connecting to audiences through musical curation (set building)  
5. Gather feedback for future, more in-depth workshops

Workshop Structure:

1. The Art of Being Seen & Heard (10 minutes)  
   * Brief personal anecdote about the transition from analog to digital  
   * Highlight the many empowering aspects of DJing ranging from small social benefits to significant cultural influence  
   * Encourage participants to think about DJing as the social construction of a metaphysical stage that exists in time and space  
2. Moving Air: The Sound System (10 minutes)  
   * Overview of the DJ sound system in an organic context  
   * Present a visual infographic showing how sound circulates the sound system  
   * Explain how each component processes aspects of sound within this system  
   * Emphasize the importance of understanding the ‘what’, ‘how’ and ‘why’ of the components rather than just knowing the terminology  
3. The Art of Musical Storytelling (10 minutes)  
   * Expand on sound as the DJ’s voice through the body of a sound system  
   * Present a curatorial musical storytelling paradigm:  
     * Songs as living, experiential memories set in cultural time and space  
     * Set composition as rhetoric and literary style  
   * List technical areas that can help refine set composition  
   * Highlight the main component of a DJ set is transition, and how that is important technically, physically and metaphysically  
   * Emphasize that this topic deserves its own dedicated workshop in the future  
4. Hands-on Exploration and Q\&A (25 minutes)  
   * Allow participants to try out equipment  
   * Encourage questions and learning from others’ inquiries  
   * Assess interest in technical subjects  
5. Wrap Up and Future Directions (5 minutes)  
   * Distribute handouts and visual aids  
   * Direct participants to the workshop’s website/host’s web platform  
   * Introduce the feedback mechanism for suggesting future workshop topics  
   * Briefly mention the importance of safety, ethics, and cultural sensitivity in DJing  
   * Invite interested participants to stay for further discussion and equipment teardown

Equipment:

* Technics 1200 turntables  
* Rane MP2015 analog and digital rotary mixer  
* Denon SC2000 MIDI controller  
* Quneo MIDI controller  
* Windows Surface Pro tablet (running Virtual DJ)  
* MacBook Pro laptop (running Virtual DJ)

Key Features:

* Hands-on approach with both analog and digital setups  
* Focus on sparking curiosity rather than detailed instruction  
* Emphasis on DJing as a form of individual and community empowerment  
* Open structure encouraging participant input for future workshops  
* Brief mention of safety, ethics, and cultural sensitivity in DJing

Throughout the workshop:

* Emphasize that this is an introductory session designed to introduce concepts  
* Encourage participants to communicate their interests for future, more in-depth workshops  
* Foster an open environment where participants feel comfortable expressing their interests and concerns
