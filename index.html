    <p><b>This is an opportunity for all</b> interested in the medium of sound. From sound systems to musical storytelling, The goal of this workshop is to shed some light on the art and science of projecting sound to facilitate participatory experience. You'll get hands-on support using different types of hardware, survey the arena of digital tools, and start the momentum to make a space for IRL support, mentorship, and collaboration. Yes, there will be turntables. If this sounds like your idea of a good time, sign up and save the date.</p>

		<blockquote>
		<h3>Do I have to be a DJ to attend?</h3>
		<p>NO. If you are interested in sound, this is for you.</p>
		<h3>If I don't sign up, can I still attend?</h3>
		<p>Yes, but there must be enough interest in the workshop for it to happen. Interest is measured by people signed up, so it's a good idea to try and sign up if you think you'd like to attend.</p>
		<h3>Can I bring a friend?</h3>
		<p>You can as long as you are mindful of the space and adhere to Satellite's visitor rules. Get in touch with one of the organizers just to make sure.</p>
		<h3>Can I help out?</h3>
		<p>So glad you asked. Yes! Help set up and tear down by arriving a half hour or so early and/or be willing to hang out afterwards.</p>

        <p><b>Presenter Leila Paper</b> is a DJ emeritus who would have loved to have a mentor back when she started. Entering the industry as a radio DJ in 1991, after 3 decades in clubs, raves and restaurants, she knows there is way more to DJing than a course could teach. Boasting a parent-disappointing depth of experience and knowledge in both vinyl and digital DJing, she is a motivated and committed mentor and industry advocate.</p>
