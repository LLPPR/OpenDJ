    <p>OpenDJ Introductory Studio<br>

    Duration: 60 minutes

    <p><strong>This is an opportunity for all</strong> interested in all things DJ. DJing as a form of musicianship is widely diverse in purpose and practice, and is as much a hobbyist practice as it is a professional one. The goal of this workshop is to shed some light on the dense topics, answer questions that only another DJ would understand, and start a momentum to make a space for IRL support, mentorship, resource sharing and artistic collaboration.</p>
    <p> In this introductory studio you'll meet with an exceptionally well-rounded mentor, discuss a DJ paradigm that frames modern DJing in an actionable and productive perspective, and have a chance to try out different kinds of gear. If this is your idea of a good time, sign up and save the date.</p>

		<h3>Do I have to be a DJ to attend?</h3>
		<p>Of course not. Everybody thinks they're a DJ anyways.</p>
		<h3>If I don't sign up, can I still attend?</h3>
		<p>Yes, but there must be enough interest in the workshop for it to happen. Interest is measured by people signed up, so it's a good idea to try and sign up if you think you'd like to attend.</p>
		<h3>Can I bring a friend?</h3>
		<p>You can as long as you are mindful of the space and adhere to Satellite's visitor rules. Get in touch with one of the organizers just to make sure.</p>
		<h3>Can I bring my own gear if I have a question?</h3>
		<p>This is an introductory workshop, so there won't be much time to get into personal gear. That being said, if you volunteer to help, there will be extra time for you.</p>
		<h3>Can I help out?</h3>
		<p>So glad you asked. Yes! Help set up and tear down by arriving a half hour or so early and/or be willing to hang out afterwards.</p>

        <p><strong>Presenter Leila Paper</strong> is a DJ emeritus who would have loved to have a mentor back when she started. Entering the industry as a radio DJ in 1991, after 3 decades in clubs, raves and restaurants, she knows there is way more to DJing than a course could teach. Boasting a parent-disappointing depth of experience and knowledge in both vinyl and digital DJing, she is a motivated and committed mentor and industry advocate.</p>
