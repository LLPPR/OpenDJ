    <p>OpenDJ Introductory Studio<br>
    ///////////////////////////////////////////////<br>

    <p><strong>This</strong> is an opportunity for anyone and everyone who has an interest in learning and doing all things DJ. At heart, DJing is an evolving and collective art form, stretched somewhere between curator, musician, engineer and social facilitator. It's an awkward space, with a lack of IRL support, mentorship, resource sharing and collaboration.</p>
    <p>The goal of this workshop is to start a momentum to make this space happen. In this introductory studio you'll meet with an exceptionally well-rounded mentor, discuss a DJ paradigm that frames modern DJing in an actionable and productive perspective, and have a chance to try out different kinds of gear. If this is your idea of a good time, sign up and save the date.</p>

		<p><i>Do I have to be a DJ to attend?</i></p>
		<p>Of course not. Everybody thinks they're a DJ anyways.</p>
		<p><i>If I don't sign up, can I still attend?</i></p>
		<p>Probably</p>
		<p><i>Can I bring a friend?</i></p>
		<p>You can as long as you are mindful of the space and adhere to Satellite's visitor rules. Get in touch with one of the organizers just to make sure</p>
		<p><i>Can I bring my own gear if I have a question?</i></p>
		<p>This is an introductory workshop, so there won't be much time to get into personal gear. That being said, if you volunteer to help, there will be extra time for you</p>
		<p><i>Can I help out?</i></p>
		<p>So glad you asked. Yes! Help set up and tear down by arriving a half hour or so early and/or be willing to hang out afterwards</p>

        <p><strong>Presenter: Leila Paper</strong>, a DJ emeritus who thinks mentoring will be an easier way to influence the scene than doing the actual work. Entering the industry as a broadcast engineer and radio DJ in 1991, after 3 decades, she genuinely gets it. Boasting a parent-disappointing depth of theoretical knowledge and practical experience from a long and wide-ranging career. She is a motivated and committed mentor and industry advocate.<br> 
She will share her perspective of understanding sound systems and DJ gear. As a proponent of both vinyl and digital DJing, you will walk through a hands on of both set ups. Definitely bring all your questions and issues. This is the space to get answers in the spirit of support and non-judgemental encouragement.</p>
