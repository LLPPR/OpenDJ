        <h2>About the Workshop</h2>
        <p>This is an opportunity for all to get into all things DJ. At the core, DJing is an evolving and collective art form. It sits somewhere between curator, musician, engineer and social facilitator. It's a space that relies on mentorship. The goal of this workshop is to create a space to make that available. In this introductory workshop, your host is a DJ emeritus that grew up alongside profession. She will share a ground up perspective of sound systems and DJ hardware with the aim of building a solid understanding of the ecosystem as a whole. Understanding function provides a stronger foundation for making informed choices when choosing creative tools. The workshop will briefly introduce and highlight methodologies of key aspects of building impactful experiences: musical storytelling, prompted participation, and metaphysical continuity. In the spirit of mentorship and collaboration, this session aims to inspire participants to view DJing as more than just playing music, but as a vehicle to be seen and heard, and as a musician responsible for engineering audience experiences..</p>
